# Easy Life

The website easy life was designed to attract people who are aiming to get the most out of every day. The informtation site hopes to educate the users, so that they can stress less and adopt useful techniques such as meditation and life hacks which will relieve the stress from everyday life.

The website is availible and appicable to everybody weather that be man or woman however due to the nature of the content i have selected themes and colors that will attract a female audience. I ave developed this theme as it is more likely that women stressed out from work or home life will be more likely to use this site.

## Features

My website is designed to be as simple and as easy to navigate as possible which is why i chose to abandon the typical under the header navigation bar and encorperate a tile design into the main section of my page which will be used to navigate through the website. I believe this gives the best possible user experience and takes the modern mobile phone interface and adapts it to benifit a website layout.

### Existing Features

- __Header__

    - The header of my page contains the title on the left and the sign-up button on the right. The title is very clear and dominant on each of the 4 pages and has a border bottom which creates this button affect. This is becasue I want to make it clear to the users that it is a navigational icon and can be used at anytime to return to the home page.

    -   The right side of the header shows a similarly styled button which instead reads sign-up. This is a link to the sign up page which is accesible on all of the pages also. As you hover over the button an underline appears as to show the users this this is a button.

- __Tiles/Naivgation__

    - Instead of having a common naviagtion bar  as most website do, I have encorperated a simpler design which reflects that of a modern mobile phone interface. I decided to use tiles because i think it is simple, effecitve, easy to style and unique.

    - The tiles fit into the theme of the website which is meditation so instead of having messy drop down menus and complicated paths to the information you want it is made very clear and hassle free.

    - The tiles also have styling which allows them to <em>'pop out'</em> on hover and clearly display all the information of that navigation path to the user no matter the screen size.
