# Easy Life

The website easy life was designed to attract people who are aiming to get the most out of every day. The informtation site hopes to educate the users, so that they can stress less and adopt useful techniques such as meditation and life hacks which will relieve the stress from everyday life.

The website is availible and appicable to everybody weather that be man or woman however due to the nature of the content i have selected themes and colors that will attract a female audience. I ave developed this theme as it is more likely that women stressed out from work or home life will be more likely to use this site.

## Features

My website is designed to be as simple and as easy to navigate as possible which is why i chose to abandon the typical under the header navigation bar and encorperate a tile design into the main section of my page which will be used to navigate through the website. I believe this gives the best possible user experience and takes the modern mobile phone interface and adapts it to benifit a website layout.

### Existing Features

- __Header__

    - The header of my page contains the title on the left and the sign-up button on the right. The title is very clear and dominant on each of the 4 pages and has a border bottom which creates this button affect. This is becasue I want to make it clear to the users that it is a navigational icon and can be used at anytime to return to the home page.

    - The right side of the header shows a similarly styled button which instead reads sign-up. This is a link to the sign up page which is accesible on all of the pages also. As you hover over the button an underline appears as to show the users this this is a button.

- __The landing page__

    - The landing page has been designed to be as relaxing and as simple to navigate as possible, with bright and uplifiting colors it aims to shine light on the users day from the very beginning.

- __Tiles/Naivgation__

    - Instead of having a common naviagtion bar  as most website do, I have encorperated a simpler design which reflects that of a modern mobile phone interface. I decided to use tiles because i think it is simple, effecitve, easy to style and unique.

    - The tiles fit into the theme of the website which is meditation so instead of having messy drop down menus and complicated paths to the information you want it is made very clear and hassle free.

    - The tiles also have styling which allows them to <em>'pop out'</em> on hover and clearly display all the information of that navigation path to the user no matter the screen size.

- __Footer__

    - The footer includes the three main contact detials which are telephone, email and address. The reason I haven't included social media links is becuase there is a tile that will take the user to a page that will have a page dedicated to the social media links, describing my pages and how there support helps the company.

    - The footer also includes a curved border which I think adds a nice sleeqe design to the page.

- __Information Page__

    - The information page is set up to display an image and then some information about the practice they want to learn about.

- __Sign-up Page__

    - The sign-up page allows the users to create an account with out website. This will allow the user to add common practices and tehciques to a log so that they can visit them regularly rather than having to search through all of the information.

    - The sign-up page asks relevant questions to try and target the information present to each indicudal user. It does this by askign gender and age groups as reasons for visiting the website may change due to those variables.

- __Header/ Footer__

    - The header and footer are styled in serperate CSS files than the main body documents and then imported into the CSS sheets. This is so that they will always be dispalyed identically across all pages.

### Features to implement in the future

- Sign- up complete page
    
    - A page that you are directed to after you submit your sign-up page that thanks the user for signing up to the site.

- Quick suggestion bar
    
    - A bar under the main navigation bar the displays quick quggestions for users that are popular of new.
    
- Simple visual animation
    
    - I want a simple visual animation that makes each page come alive such as a slight travelling glow around the border of the page etc.
